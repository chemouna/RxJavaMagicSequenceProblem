## Solving Magic Sequence problem in Rxjava 

### The Problem : 

Given that we have two buttons, A and B, we want to print a message if a “secret combination” 
(ABBABA) is clicked within 5 seconds. To make things a bit harder the following must also be true:

The message should be printed immediately when the secret combination is clicked. We should not wait 
until the end of the 5 second interval before the message is printed.
As soon as the secret combination is fulfilled (within 5 seconds) the message should be displayed 
regardless of what has been clicked before. For example a combination like “BBABBABA” is ok as long 
as “ABBABA” is clicked within 5 seconds.
